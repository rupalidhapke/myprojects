    <h2 class="heading">The Solar System[c] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it.[4] The largest
        of these objects are the eight planets, which in order from the Sun are four terrestrial planets (Mercury,
        Venus, Earth and Mars); two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn); and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). The Solar
        System developed 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun and a
        protoplanetary disc.
